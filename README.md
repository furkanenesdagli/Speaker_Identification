Overview
This project involves extracting features from audio files, developing a deep learning-based classification model using these features, and classifying the audio files with the trained model. The process includes the following steps:

Feature Extraction: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used to extract features from the audio files. MFCC is a popular feature extraction technique in speech and audio processing that captures the power spectrum of a sound.

Model Development: A three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) model is trained using the extracted features. The model architecture is designed to efficiently learn and classify the patterns in the audio data.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using a cross-validation method, which ensures that the model's performance is reliable and generalizes well to unseen data. High accuracy rates were achieved, indicating the effectiveness of the model.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Speaker Recognition Audio Dataset from Kaggle. It contains audio files from 50 different speakers, providing a diverse set of samples for training and evaluating the model.

Objective
